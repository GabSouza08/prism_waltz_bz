Prism Waltz is a turn-based strategy RPG where players select champions from rival Houses to battle in dramatic duels and team clashes.
Each champion wields unique Echo-Arts—special abilities powered by an Echo Gauge—and can form bonds for powerful duo attacks. 
The game features tactical combat, thematic music, and narrative-driven rivalries, challenging players to outwit AI opponents and unlock new echoes as they master the arena.
